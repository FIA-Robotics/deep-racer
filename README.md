# DeepRacer - FIA Robotics
DeepRacer contains FIA Robotics software related to the AWS DeepRacer Project.

## Information about the Project
AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18th scale race car that is controlled using Reinforcement Learning, i.e. the car learns to drive by being rewarded for good behaviour and punished for undesired behaviour. The goal is to drive as fast as posible around a circuit and compete in races against other teams using identical cars. For more information related to the project go to https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/

### Git conventions
To ensure that colaboration is easy and painless we follow some git conventions as described below.

#### Branches
- Never push to master.
- Create a new branch for each feature. Branch names should follow the [angular conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit). Example: `new-feature`
- Open a pull request when you want to merge branches into master.
- Get another team member to review code and merge pull request.

#### Commits

- Please follow the [Angular commit message conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit). Prefix all commits with types. E.g. `perf: Change bubblesort to quicksort`

- All commit messages should be on imperative, present form.  
  Do: `feat: Add q-learning to apples-game`  
  Don't: `Added new feature`
